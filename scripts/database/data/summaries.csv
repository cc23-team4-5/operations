1;1;0;1;"The narrator, born into slavery in Maryland, expresses his lack of knowledge about his age due to the practice of keeping slaves ignorant of their birthdays. He recounts his separation from his mother at an early age, the limited and secretive interactions they had, and her eventual death. The narrator reflects on the speculation surrounding his white father, possibly his master, but acknowledges that it doesn't significantly affect his circumstances as slaveholders have established that the condition of slavery follows the mother's status. He discusses the hardships faced by mixed-race slaves, who often suffer more and are sold by their masters to appease their white wives' concerns. The narrator suggests that the increasing number of mixed-race slaves challenges the notion that slavery is justified by the biblical curse on Ham's descendants. He then describes his first master, Captain Anthony, and the brutal overseer, Mr. Plummer, who inflicted severe punishments on the slaves. The narrator vividly recalls witnessing his own aunt, Aunt Hester, being brutally whipped, an event that deeply affected him and exposed the cruel reality of slavery. He concludes by expressing his fear of being the next victim and reveals that he had previously lived with his grandmother away from the main plantation, shielded from such horrors.";
2;2;0;2;"The narrator, a former slave, describes his experience on Colonel Edward Lloyd's plantation. The plantation was located in Talbot County and was a prosperous farm producing tobacco, corn, and wheat. The narrator's master, Captain Auld, owned a large number of slaves and managed the plantation as an overseer. The slaves on the plantation had to work hard in the fields and were subject to harsh treatment.\nThe overseers of the neighboring farms received guidance from the managers on the home plantation, and disputes among overseers were settled there. If a slave misbehaved or attempted to escape, they were severely punished and often sold to slave traders. The home plantation served as a central location where the slaves received their monthly food allowance and yearly clothing. The slaves lived in crowded and uncomfortable conditions, often sleeping on the cold floor with minimal bedding.\nThe narrator describes two overseers, Mr. Severe and Mr. Hopkins. Mr. Severe was cruel, enjoying inflicting punishment and using profanity. He died soon after the narrator arrived, and his death was seen as a relief by the slaves. Mr. Hopkins, on the other hand, was seen as a comparatively less cruel overseer.\nThe home plantation also functioned as a hub for various activities, including shoemaking, blacksmithing, weaving, and grinding grains, all performed by the slaves. The slaves considered it a privilege to be selected for errands at the "Great House Farm," as it indicated trust from the overseers. When selected, the slaves would sing joyfully on their way to the farm, expressing both happiness and sadness in their songs.\nThe narrator reflects on the significance of the slaves' songs, realizing that they conveyed deep sorrow and served as a form of release from the harsh realities of slavery. Contrary to popular belief, the slaves' singing was not a sign of contentment but rather a reflection of their suffering. The narrator compares it to crying, explaining that the songs expressed the sorrows of their hearts.";
3;3;0;3;"The text describes the life of Colonel Lloyd, a wealthy slaveholder, and the conditions on his plantation. One notable feature is his large and well-maintained garden, which attracts visitors from nearby cities. However, the garden also causes trouble as slaves are tempted to steal fruit from it, resulting in punishments such as lashings. The colonel devises a plan to tar the fence surrounding the garden, making it evident if a slave has come into contact with it. The text also highlights Colonel Lloyd's extensive riding equipage and his meticulousness in caring for his horses. The responsibility for the stable falls on two slaves, old Barney and young Barney, who face severe punishment for any perceived neglect. The text emphasizes that Colonel Lloyd and his family members, who reside on the plantation, regularly inflict physical abuse on the slaves. The slaves endure harsh treatment, including being whipped for trivial reasons or without cause. The author further explains that Colonel Lloyd owns a large number of slaves, to the point where he does not recognize them all. A particular incident is recounted in which a slave unknowingly spoke to Colonel Lloyd, criticizing his treatment, only to be later sold as punishment. The text suggests that slaves are often compelled to praise their masters and hide the truth about their conditions out of fear of retribution. Slaves are known to vie for their masters' superiority while simultaneously disliking them individually. This leads to conflicts and fights between slaves from different plantations, as they defend the alleged greatness of their respective masters.";
